## Want to get started on a digital American studies project?

We may be able to help!

At this year’s American Studies Association annual meeting in Chicago, the [Digital Humanities Caucus](http://www.theasa.net/caucus_digital_humanities/) would like to help you get started on a digital project by offering
 
-	two-hour consultations with experienced digital humanities practitioners. We can think your idea through with you, suggest useful tools and resources, and give you some suggestions about where you might go next.
-	an idea clinic with drop-in and group conversations about digital projects, whether you are ready to start, hitting a snag, looking for a sounding board, or just curious

What is a digital project? Our definition is broad, and we’ll do our best to help you accomplish whatever you’re imagining. Some popular types of projects include maps, data visualizations, text analysis projects, and experiments in scholarly publishing and pedagogy.

We think American studies scholars have the potential to undertake transformative digital scholarship, and we’re offering these consultations in the hopes of fostering some of this work.

We’ll hold these consultations from 5 to 6 p.m. on Friday, November 9, Westin Peachtree Plaza Atlanta, Piedmont 6.
